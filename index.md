### CPSC 120

* Lab 02

One of my favorite Labs was lab 2. This is one of my favorite labs because of the fact that it was basically one of my very first college level labs where we actually dug into the coding aspect of computer science. I feel like this one really stuck to me because it had such a deep meaning behind it because I truly did learn a lot from it as well as it being my first ever lab.

* Lab 03

My second favorite Lab was lab 3. This lab was one of my favorites because it was one of the very first labs that truly challenged me so much. I find this one to be one of my favorites because it was the first one where I had a bit of a difficult time to complete, but in the end I did complete it and it was very fun.

* Lab 12

My third and final favorite lab was lab 12. This is my last favorite lab because I learned a lot about picture implementing, and color implementing. I think the last few labs of the semester were a tough bunch to pick from but I would definitely say lab 12 was my favorite because it was extremely challenging and fun to do.
